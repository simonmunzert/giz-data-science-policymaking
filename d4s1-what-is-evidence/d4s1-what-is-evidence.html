# Day 4: Informed consumption of evidence

## Sessions

--
1. What is evidence? And how can it inform policy?

--
2. Evidence synthesis and meta-analysis

--
3. Navigating the world of evidence: A practical workshop for effective research

--
4. How to read an academic study?

--

## Learning goals

--
- To familiarize ourselves with the **scientific research** process and different types of **evidence**.

--
- To evaluate the **strengths** and **limitations** of using evidence to inform policy decisions.

--
- To develop skills to critically **evaluate** the quality and reliability of different types of **evidence**

# A show of hands!

### Raise your hand if you:

--
- have heard the term evidence-based policymaking

--
- can define what evidence-based policymaking means

--
- can give us an example of evidence-based policymaking from your own work

--
- have relied on your past experiences to inform your policy work

--
- have integrated input from potential beneficiaries into policy

--
- have ever produced an impact evaluation report

--
- have read an evaluation report [academic article] in the past six months

--
- have ever read an evaluation report [academic article] for work

--
- have used an evaluation report [academic article] to inform policy

# Improved decision-making (cont.)

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- **Background:** France's immigrant population, particularly from West and North Africa, faces higher unemployment rates, often attributed to educational disparities and discrimination.

--

- **Policy Initiative:** In 2006, France introduced a law to anonymize job application materials but later shifted to a voluntary program in 2009 through Pôle Emploi (*France's unemployment government agency*).

--

- **Research Methodology:** .i-pink[Academic collaboration] with Pôle Emploi allowed for evaluating the impact of anonymous resumes on interview and hiring rates.

--

- **Implementation:** Over 1,000 firms participated, with resumes randomly assigned to either anonymous or standard format groups.

# Improved decision-making (cont.)

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- **Findings:**
    - No significant change in the number of interviews or job offers in either group.
    - Anonymizing resumes led to &lt;i style="color:#cc0065"&gt;decreased interview and hiring rates for minority candidates&lt;/i&gt;.
    - The interview gap between minority and non-minority candidates widened by 10.7 percentage points.

--

- **Implications:**
    - Participating firms, more likely to hire minorities traditionally, were impacted negatively by anonymized resumes. 
    - Anonymization may hinder the identification and assessment of minority candidates.

--

- **Policy Outcome:** The discussion prompted by the evaluation led to the abandonment of the policy in 2015.
