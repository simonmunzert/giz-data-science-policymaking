# Improved decision-making (cont.)

<br><br><br>

- **Background:** France's immigrant population, particularly from West and North Africa, faces higher unemployment rates, often attributed to educational disparities and discrimination.

--

- **Policy Initiative:** In 2006, France introduced a law to anonymize job application materials but later shifted to a voluntary program in 2009 through Pôle Emploi (*France's unemployment government agency*).

--

- **Research Methodology:** .i-pink[Academic collaboration] with Pôle Emploi allowed for evaluating the impact of anonymous resumes on interview and hiring rates.

--

- **Implementation:** Over 1,000 firms participated, with resumes randomly assigned to either anonymous or standard format groups.

# Improved decision-making (cont.)

<br><br><br>

- **Findings:**
    - No significant change in the number of interviews or job offers in either group.
    - Anonymizing resumes led to <i style="color:#cc0065">decreased interview and hiring rates for minority candidates</i>.
    - The interview gap between minority and non-minority candidates widened by 10.7 percentage points.

--

- **Implications:**
    - Participating firms, more likely to hire minorities traditionally, were impacted negatively by anonymized resumes. 
    - Anonymization may hinder the identification and assessment of minority candidates.

--

- **Policy Outcome:** The discussion prompted by the evaluation led to the abandonment of the policy in 2015.

Some of the things we can do: .i-pink[(identify problems; measure)]

--

- Monitor SDG advancement by extracting meaningful measures of the global digital gender gap using Facebook ad data `r Citep(bib, "fatehkia2018using", before = "e.g., ", .opts = list(max.names = 1, longnamesfirst = FALSE))`

--

- Measure poverty remotely by combining satellite imagery and machine learning `r Citep(bib, "jean2016combining", before = "e.g., ", .opts = list(max.names = 1, longnamesfirst = FALSE))`

--

- Infer public transport demand and infrastructure usage by combining mobile phone, geospatial, census records, and survey data `r Citep(bib, "toole2015path", before = "e.g., ", .opts = list(max.names = 1, longnamesfirst = FALSE))`

Some of the things we can do: .i-pink[(review; assess likely consequences; evaluate)]

--

- Conduct large, low-cost, experiments and assess compliance with interventions with consensual data tracking `r Citep(bib, c("guess2023social", "munzert2021tracking"), before = "e.g., ", .opts = list(max.names = 1, longnamesfirst = FALSE))`

--

- Design more cost-efficient experiments with balanced treatment assignments `r Citep(bib, "arbour2021efficient", before = "e.g., ", .opts = list(max.names = 1, longnamesfirst = FALSE))`

--

- Extracting more precise causal estimates through estimators that leverage increased computational power, such as double ML and synthetic controls `r Citep(bib, c("knaus2022double","abadie2015comparative"), before = "e.g., ", .opts = list(max.names = 1, longnamesfirst = FALSE))`
