# What those books are about

.pull-left[

**Critical Thinking Detective**

<i>"This colorful 32-page book offers a collection of fun, easy-to-use detective cases for Grades 4–12+. Some cases may be more challenging for younger students, but teachers and parents can always provide hints when needed. The cases <mark>develop critical thinking skills</mark> by requiring students to read carefully and <mark>analyze and synthesize information to guide their decision-making</mark>. The cases also develop observation skills, reading comprehension, deductive and inductive thinking skills. The ability to identify and evaluate evidence is the very heart of critical thinking."</i>

.pull-right[

**The Sherlock Holmes Case Book**

<i>"Join the world's greatest fictional detective and use your own powers of deduction to solve these puzzling mysteries. The Sherlock Holmes Case Book: Solve-It-Yourself Mysteries is a remarkable collection of crimes from Dr John Watson's case notes that features all of the twists and turns that have come to be expected from a Holmes case – but now it is up to you to solve them.

There are 10 cases to be cracked, each of which <mark>requires the reader to use logic and powers of perception to answer a question at three points – the beginning, the middle and the end</mark>."</i>

# Causal thinking as detective work

.pull-left-wide[
## The premise

- Observational **causal inference** is like detective work<sup>1</sup>
- We have to **piece together evidence** to solve a puzzle of whether the suspect - the treatment - in fact causally changed the outcome
- To that end, we need to **eliminate alternative explanations**

## The equipment

- **Our toolbox:** Critical thinking and logic, observation (data collection), perception (measurement), external knowledge, and statistical methods
- Without the qualitative skills, the quantitative methods are pointless

.footnote[<sup>1</sup>"Observational" does some heavy lifting here; for the experimental causal inference analogy, we'd probably the ones committing the murder.]

> [Study author Dianna Kenny] found that musicians from older genres – including blues, jazz, country and gospel – have similar lifespans to American people their own age.

## Some issues

1. **Sanity check:** Are some genres really that deadly? E.g., do rap musicians really die at an average age of ~30?
2. **Right censoring:** Some genres are younger than others and the data are conditional on musicians having died already. Most rap and hip-hop stars are still alive today; we don't know how long they'll live!
3. **Conditional probabilities:** The probabilities of each cause of death are conditional on death having already occurred at the time of the study.
4. (Minor issue) A line graph for categorical data?  [Not a good idea.](https://www.jmp.com/en_gb/statistics-knowledge-portal/exploratory-data-analysis/line-graph.html#:~:text=Line%20graphs%20do%20not%20make,might%20have%20a%20defined%20order.)

## Some thoughts

1. A quasi-experimental design does not protect you from measurement or model specification issues.

2. Using higher-order polynomials in RDDs can be problematic and generate bias (see [Gelman and Zelizer, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168015569830).

3. The follow-up study seemed to address many of those issues.

4. Science (sometimes) is a self-correcting enterprise. Progress through higher quality of evidence is possible.
