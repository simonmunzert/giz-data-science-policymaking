# Overview

.pull-left[
## Setup

- For our course you will have a group assignment.
- You will be divided into group of 3-4 participants. 
- This assignment will be merged with **Leo Iacovone's course assignment**.
- For our course, you will **extend the presentation** by adding elements that speak to our element on data science for policy-making.
- Thus, **the deliverable will be a presentation**, consisting of the content asked by Leo and the content asked by us.
]

.pull-right[
## Learning outcomes

- The objective is for you to apply what you learn through the course.
- You have prepare a presentation to put in practice your skills about:
  1. Collecting high quality evidence
  2. Assessing use of evidence in policy documents
  3. Using concrete evidence to write a policy/program proposal and its evaluation plan
]

# Topic choice

.pull-left[

## Procedure

1. You have formed groups. **Correct?**

2. Leo has asked you to choose one topic of interest that is linked to topics from the following list:

-	Health and nutrition
-	Enterprise development
-	Income and employability support
-	Trade facilitation and competitiveness
-	Road infrastructure
-	Nutrition and health
-	Agricultural productivity
-	Education

# Assignment part 1

.pull-left-small2[
## Collecting evidence (Leo's part)
- This first part of the presentation will focus on collecting evidence for your program/policy.
- You need to prepare a **6-8 slides summary of the evidence**, and you could use tables to summarize it.
- More details in Leo's syllabus.
]

.pull-right-wide2[
## Making the case for the policy (Our part)

- Precede the evidence with a **2 slides introduction** that makes the case for the program/policy.
- The **first slide** should be framed around one piece of <span style="color:blue"><b>visual evidence</b></span>. This can be from a research paper, a blog post, etc. and help highlight the problem that the policy is trying to address.
- The **second slide** summarizes the program/policy and its objectives.

## Judging the quality of the evidence
- Provide a <span style="color:blue"><b>tabular overview</b></span> of the different sources of evidence you collected for Leo's part.
- The table should be ranked by the quality of evidence you attach to each source, and a column that briefly justifies your judgment (along criteria of **external and internal validity of the evidence as well as practical usefulness**).
- That is **1-2 slides** additional to Leo's part.
]

# Assignment part 2

.pull-left[
## Assess existing program/policy (Leo's part)
- The second part of your assignment will require you to choose one of the projects suggested and assess it or provide a discussion and grade it on how well evidence was incorporated.
- The program/policy should be in the same technical area that you have chosen (ideally the same topic/project).
- Your assignment is to prepare a **4-5 page presentation** assessing how well the program/policy incorporates evidence and grade it (on a scale 0-100) and justify your grade based on the evidence that you collected in your previous assignment.
- See Leo's syllabus for more details regarding the rating criteria.
]

.pull-right[
## Our part
- Provide a <span style="color:blue"><b>tabular assessment</b></span> of both the **external and internal validity of the evidence** used in the policy document.
- Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence used in the policy document on both dimensions.
- That is **1-2 slides** additional to Leo's part.
]

# Assignment part 3

.pull-left[
## Using the evidence (Leo's part)
- In the final part of your assignment you will design and propose a program based on the policy/program that you identified (assignment part 1), or the one that you reviewed (assignment part 2). Your presentation should include the following sections (again, more details in Leo's syllabus):
  1. Context and problem definition (**3-4 slides**). 
  2. Theory of change with specific reference to summary of evidence on which you base it (**3-4 slides**).
  3. Evaluation plan: How will the program generate further evidence? (**2-3 slides**) 
]

.pull-right[
## Our part
- Provide a <span style="color:blue"><b>DAG</b></span> that clarifies the relationship between the policy/treatment/intervention and **one** outcome of interest, and other variables that would affect the causal relationship (confounders etc.).
- Provide a <span style="color:blue"><b>plan for data collection and management</b></span> that discusses how you would plan to measure KPIs, policy exposure, etc.
- Provide a <span style="color:blue"><b>discussion of the ethics of your program</b></span>. What could be positive and negative externalities for citizens affected or not affected by the program? And how could possible negative externalities be mitigated?
- Overall, that is **6-8 additional slides**.
]
