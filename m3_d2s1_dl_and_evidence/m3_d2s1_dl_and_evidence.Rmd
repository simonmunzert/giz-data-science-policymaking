# What is data science?

.pull-left[
## What is data science?

> "Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> "Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data." - [Chikio Hayashi](https://www.springer.com/book/9784431702085)

Overall, there's **no consensus** - it is a buzzword after all. We're going to carry on with Conway's working definition.

# Types of data-driven research and their role for policy

.pull-left-small2[
## 1. Description
- What is the state of the world?
- What are the trends over time?
- What are the differences between groups?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **monitoring**
- "How many people consume misinformation online?"
- "How many people are unemployed in a certain district?"
- "How does the distribution of income vary across educational segments of the population?"
]

--

.pull-left-small2[
## 2. Explanation
- What is the effect of a policy?
- Does the effect vary across groups?
- What are the mechanisms behind the effect?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **evaluation**
- "Did the minimum wage increase lead to a decrease in employment?"
- "Did the campaign affect the exposure to misinformation differently across groups?"
- "Why did the intervention not lead to the expected results?"
]

--

.pull-left-small2[
## 3. Prediction
- What is the path of an indicator?
- (When) will future events happen?
- What class does this observation most likely belong to?


## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **forecasting** but also **targeting** and **measurement**
- "Will there be conflict?"
- "How many people will be unemployed in a certain district next year?"
- "Which individuals are most likely to be affected by a policy?"
]

# Calling out bad evidence when you see it

.pull-left-small[

## 1. Learn not to be fooled by 

- big data
- garbage data
- garbage models
- weird samples
- claims of generality
- statistical significance
- implausibly large effect sizes
- highly precise forecasts
- overfitted models


## 2. Consume policy-relevant evidence effectively and efficiently

## 3. Apply elements of data science to policy-making

# What we're not going to cover

.pull-left-small2[
## Programming
- Python, R, SQL, etc. skills are essential for data science
- The learning curve is steep and requires practice
- We're happy to provide a glimpse behind the curtain if that is of interest, and provide additional resources

<div align="center">

.pull-left-small2[
## Active modeling
- Building designs and models - explanatory and predictive - requires more theoretical and practical knowledge than we can cover in this workshop
- Focusing on the principles of statistical and causal reasoning should be sufficient to critically assess designs and models
<br><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="../pics/modeling-picture.jpeg" height=150>

.pull-right-small2[
## Advanced machine learning, NLP
- ML, DL, NLP are technologies that drive many of the most exciting applications of data science
- Understanding what happens under the hood requires a solid foundation in math and stats
- We will focus on fundamental elements of ML-based research

# Descriptive vs. inferential statistics

.pull-left[
## Descriptive statistics
- Summarize and describe characteristics of a sample or population
- Can be communicated numerically and visually
- Different scales (levels of measurement) require different descriptive statistics
- Good description can be challenging if data collection or measurement is complex
]

.pull-right[
## Inferential statistics
- Make inferences about a population based on a sample
- Can be inferences about means, proportions, relationships, etc.
- Can be communicated numerically and visually
- Good description is the basis for good inference

# Measures of central tendency


.pull-left[
## Three popular measures of central tendency

- **(Arithmetic) Mean**: The **average** of all values in a dataset
- **Median**: The **middle** value of a dataset
- **Mode**: The **most frequent** value in a dataset

Why "central tendency"? Describes the tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value.

## Try it out

Identify the mode, median, and mean of the following values:

8, 2, 4, 2, 18, 6, 2
]

--

.pull-right[
## Which one to use?

- **Mean**: Sensitive to outliers, but with an intuitive meaning
- **Median**: Robust to outliers, but a bit less intuitive
- **Mode**: Useful for categorical data, but can be misleading for continuous data

## Skewed distributions

# Samples and representativity

.pull-left[
## A folk definition of representativity

A sample (or data in general) is "representative" if **conclusions drawn from the sample can be generalized** to the population of interest.
]

.pull-right[
## A more formal definition

A sample is representative if it is drawn in such a way that it is **statistically indistinguishable** from the population of interest.

| **Group/Firm** | No. of women (under treatment) |  No. of women (under control) |

## The fundamental problem of causal inference

- Why is the causal effect of X on Y not simply the difference between the upper-left and lower-right cell in the table?
- We can only observe one of the two potential outcomes!

- The .i-pink[average treatment effect (ATE)] is the average of everyone's individual treatment effect (ITE). In this case:
    - $= \frac{(-1)+(-2)+0+1+(-2)+0+(-1)+1}{8}$
    - $= \frac{(-4)}{8}$
    - $= -0.5$
    
- The actual effect of the blind-review policy is an **expected reduction of 0.5 women hired on average** 🤔.

Dissecting more complex graphs into these basic patterns can help to understand the causal structure of the data-generating process. This will be **key to understanding how to adjust for confounding** in regression analysis.

# A recap...

<div align="center">
<img src="../pics/open-close-paths.png" width=800>
</div>

--
- A path is **open** or unblocked **at non-colliders** (confounders or mediators)

--
- A path is (naturally) **blocked at colliders**

--
- An **open path induces statistical association** between two variables

- Absence of an open path implies statistical independence

# Regression adjustment with DAGs

.pull-left[
## Example

- What variables should we control for to identify the effect of $D$ on $Y$?

## Follow these simple steps:

1. Identify the **causal** and **non-causal** paths from $D$ to $Y$
2. Are the **non-causal paths naturally closed** (.i-pink[by a collider])?
3. What should we condition on to **close open non-causal** paths?
4. Would something change if we could observe $U$?

## Some issues

1. **Sanity check:** Are some genres really that deadly? E.g., do rap musicians really die at an average age of ~30?
2. **Right censoring:** Some genres are younger than others and the data are conditional on musicians having died already. Most rap and hip-hop stars are still alive today; we don't know how long they'll live!
3. **Conditional probabilities:** The probabilities of each cause of death are conditional on death having already occurred at the time of the study.
4. (Minor issue) A line graph for categorical data?  [Not a good idea.](https://www.jmp.com/en_gb/statistics-knowledge-portal/exploratory-data-analysis/line-graph.html#:~:text=Line%20graphs%20do%20not%20make,might%20have%20a%20defined%20order.)

Evidence can be made up of a range of components – *not only scientific* – and is never used in isolation. Scientific evidence typically [relies on] surveys, quantitative/statistical data, qualitative data, and [the] analysis thereof. However, evidence also includes economic, attitudinal, behavioural and anecdotal [insight], together with … experience, history, analogies, local knowledge and culture `r Citep(bib, "strydom2010evidence", .opts = list(max.names = 1, longnamesfirst = FALSE))`

*Evidence-based policymaking* involves utilizing *high-quality information* to guide decisions regarding government policies. This process entails *systematically* collecting robust data and analyzing them with *rigorous* research methods to generate reliable evidence.

# Challenges to evidence-based policymaking

.pull-left[
## Supply-side challenges

1. **Data Availability and Quality**
    - Insufficient or low-quality data.
2. **Research Funding and Resources**
    - Limited funding for research can restrict the scope and depth of studies.
3. **Technical Expertise**
    - Shortage of skilled researchers and analysts.
4. **Time Constraints**
    - Mismatch between the timelines of research cycles and policy decision-making cycles.
5. **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**
    - Issues related to data privacy and ethical considerations in data collection and usage.
6. **Political and Institutional Barriers**
    - Political pressure to influence the direction and outcomes of studies.
    - Bureaucratic inertia and resistance to adopting new research methodologies or findings.
]


.pull-right[
## Demand-side challenges

1. **Political Will and Ideology**
    - Political ideology over evidence.
    - Unpopular policies despite strong evidence?
2. **Public Perception and Trust**
    - Public skepticism or mistrust of scientific evidence.
3. **Resource Constraints**
    - Limited budgets to implement.
    - Competing priorities of immediate needs over long-term evidence-based solutions.
4. **Complexity and Uncertainty**
    - Complexity of translating scientific evidence into practical and actionable policies.
5. **Interest Groups and Lobbying**
    - Pressure from powerful stakeholders.
6. **Institutional and Cultural Resistance**
    - Institutional inertia and resistance to change within government bodies.
    - Cultural resistance to new policies that challenge traditional practices or norms.

# When is knowledge used?

.pull-center[
<br>
A key concern for us is to establish whether evidence will be, or is, .i-pink['used'], but what does '**using evidence**'<br>actually mean? And, how can evidence go on and .i-pink[inform policy decisions]?
]
<br><br>


.content-box-gray-wide[

Largely, research has conceptualized **knowledge use** under three larger "buckets":

- .i-pink[Instrumental] use to facilitate **decision making**.
- .i-pink[Conceptual] use to facilitate **understanding** or reflection on problems; issues or solutions.
- .i-pink[Symbolic or tactical] use consisting of using evidence to achieve **strategic** or **political objectives**.]



---
class: midtext

# When is knowledge used? (cont.)

- **Knowledge-driven model:** Think of use of evidence as a sequential process. The notion is that some new knowledge discloses some opportunity that may have relevance for public policy. (*Basic research -> Applied research -> Development -> Application*)

- **Problem-solving model:** A problem exists and a decision has to be made, information or understanding is lacking either to generate a solution to the problem or to select among alternative solutions, .i-pink[research provides the missing knowledge]. With the gap filled, a decision is reached. (*Application of evidence to pending decisions*)

- **Interactive model:** A dynamic process where multiple stakeholders make sense of a problem with their talents, beliefs, and understandings. The use of evidence is .i-pink[only one part of a complicated process] that also uses experience, political insight, pressure, social technologies, and judgment.

- **Political model:** Actors with predetermined positions. Evidence can still be used. It becomes .i-pink[ammunition] for the side that finds its conclusions congenial and supportive.

- **Tactical model:** Evidence is not used for its substance, but to show that .i-pink[something was done]. Evidence is used as proof of responsiveness, tactic for delaying action, deflecting criticism, or enhancing agency prestige. (*People seem to agree this matters, so we may as well integrate it in some way*)

- **Enlightment model:** Scientific research and evaluation concepts and perspectives shape policy indirectly. They sensitize decision-makers to new issues and changes policy agendas. It is not the findings of a single study nor even of a body of related studies that directly affect policy. Rather it is the .i-pink[concepts and theoretical perspectives] that permeate the policy-making process.

# Mapping science onto policy

1. .i-pink[identify problems], such as endangered species, obesity, unemployment, and vulnerability to natural disasters or terrorist acts; 
2. .i-pink[measure] their magnitude and seriousness; 
3. .i-pink[review] alternative policy interventions; 
4. systematically assess the .i-pink[likely consequences] of particular policy actions—intended and unintended, desired and unwanted; and 
5. .i-pink[evaluate] what, in fact, results from policy.

# Use with care

## Limitations of AI tools

- **Quality of Data Input:** AI tools heavily rely on the quality and relevance of the data inputted. If the initial data used to train the AI model is biased or incomplete, it can affect the accuracy of the results generated by the tool. (**Garbage in/garbage out**)
- **Limited Contextual Understanding:** AI tools may lack the ability to understand the broader context of a research topic or the specific needs of a policymaker. This can lead to oversights or inaccuracies in the synthesis of evidence.
- **Inability to Handle Ambiguity:** AI tools may struggle with ambiguity or uncertainty present in research literature. They may not effectively handle conflicting findings or nuanced interpretations, which are common in complex policy areas.
- **Risk of Overlooking Unconventional Sources:** AI tools often prioritize well-established sources and may overlook valuable insights from non-traditional or emerging sources of evidence, such as preprints, grey literature, or community reports.
- **Difficulty in Adapting to Rapidly Evolving Fields:** In fast-paced fields where new research emerges frequently, AI tools may struggle to keep pace with the latest developments and may not provide up-to-date synthesis of evidence.

---

# Use with care (cont.)

## Limitations of AI tools

- **Lack of Transparency:** Some AI algorithms operate as black boxes, meaning they lack transparency in how they arrive at their conclusions. This can make it challenging for users to understand and interpret the rationale behind the recommendations or results provided by the tool.
- **Dependency on Technical Skills:** Using AI tools often requires a certain level of technical proficiency, including understanding how to interpret and adjust algorithm parameters. This can create barriers for users who lack the necessary skills or training.
- **Cost and Accessibility:** Some AI-powered tools may come with significant costs or subscription fees, making them inaccessible to users with limited budgets or resources, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
- **Ethical Considerations:** AI tools may inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the data or algorithm design, leading to unintended consequences such as reinforcing existing disparities or overlooking marginalized voices.
- **Human Oversight and Validation Required:** Despite the automation provided by AI tools, human oversight and validation are still essential to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and ethical integrity of the synthesized evidence.

- Ethical thinking is not an exercise of ticking boxes.
- A set of principles can guide researchers in reflecting about the ethical implications of their research.
- In different contexts these principles can come into conflict with each other.
- In fact, the most interesting cases are when the ethical implications of research involve trade-offs of principles.
- By making principles explicit, those trade-offs can be clarified and decisions better communicated.
- We will focus on the following four principles:

  1. Respect for persons
  2. Beneficence
  3. Justice
  4. Respect for law and public interest
