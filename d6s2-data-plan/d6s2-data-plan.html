- We often define them by their **source** (*e.g. administrative, historical, medical, etc.*) and their **formats** (*e.g., numerical, textual, still image, geospatial, audio, video, and software.*)

# Personal data

Any data that enables you to **identify a person** is classified as personal data. In the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) personal data are .i-pink[any information relating to] an **identified** or **identifiable** natural person known as ‘a data subject’&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The GDPR applies only to the data of living persons. Data which do not count as personal data do not fall under data protection legislation, though there might still be ethical reasons for protecting this information.]
--

.pull-left-wide[

## Sensitive personal data

Certain personal data can .i-pink[require specific protection] when they reveal information that may create important *risks* for the *fundamental rights* and *freedoms* of the involved individual. In the context of GDPR, these can be:

- Racial or ethnic origin;
- Political opinions;
- Religious or philosophical beliefs;
- Trade union membership;
- Genetic data;
- Biometric data;
- Data concerning health;
- Data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

# Data protection


.pull-left[
## Research ethics

The moral **principles** and **actions** guiding and shaping research

&lt;b style="color:#1D375B"&gt;In policy analysis&lt;/b&gt; is closely linked to research ethics in the social sciences.
- Initially, a 'patient protection' model from medical research.
- Today it has a broader scope, including:
    - consideration of &lt;i style="color:#cc0065"&gt;benefits, risks, and harms&lt;/i&gt;
    - &lt;i style="color:#cc0065"&gt;to all persons&lt;/i&gt; connected with and affected by the research
- Gives **responsibilities** to researchers and analysts (e.g., *legal framework*).

# What is "data protection"?


.pull-left[
## Data protection

- Part of fundamental .i-pink[right to privacy] (or 'informational freedom’).
- In research there might be instances of tensions of fundamental rights:
    - Freedom of research vs. freedom of personal information.
- “Privacy is a personal condition of life characterized by seclusion from, and therefore absence of acquaintance by, the public” (Neethling 2005).
- **Core**:
    - prevention of unwanted disclosure of personal information or
    - the misuse of such information.

## Art 4 Par 11 GDPR


&gt;“‘(C)onsent’ of the data subject means **any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes** by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies **agreement to the processing of personal data** relating to him or her;”

]

.pull-right[

## Conditions for consent

- Written form no longer required.
- Conditions for consent (Art 7 GDPR):
    - Requirement to provide evidence (Par1)
    - Separation requirement (Par2)
    - Easy revocability at any time (Par3) 
    - Increased requirement of voluntariness (Par4)
- More stringent for minors under 14 years of age (Art 8 GDPR).
- Important: Collection of "special categories" of personal data "prohibited" under Art 9 GDPR, unless there is a legal basis.


- **Central**: .i-pink[consent needs to be documented!]

# Can we process data without consent? (in research)

.pull-left[
## Are &lt;span style="color:#cc0065"&gt;researchers&lt;/span&gt; allowed to process data that was collected without consent? 

- .i-pink[It depends...]
- May need to try to gain consent after the data was gathered.
- They may skip this step, if "the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort" (Art 14 Par 5 Lit b).
- But this is no default!
- **Disproportionate really means disproportionate**.

## Consent after the fact is a balance of interests

# Consent after the dact and the balance of interests

## "Balance of interest" - checklist: 

- Legitimate interest of the researcher?
- Is the data processing necessary?
    - Are the more lenient ways to achieve research goal?
- Can the subject refuse to the processing?
- Are these data linked (or linkable) to other data?
- How long will the data be stored?
- How many people are going to access the data?
- Are the research subjects from a vulnerable group?
- Would the research subjects have to expect the processing of their data?

## THINK CLOSELY: if research subjects’ interest weigh more than yours, data processing is improper

# Secure storage

.pull-left[
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
## Technical and organizational measures (TOMs)

- **The security of out data**

&gt; TOMs should be designed to "implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects" (Art 25 Par 1 GDPR).

# Pseudonymization and anonymization

.pull-left[
## Pseudonymization

**(Art 4 Par 1 No 5 GDPR)**:
&gt; "processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is     kept separately and     is subject to technical and organisational measures     to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;"


## With pseudonymization the &lt;span style="color:#cc0065"&gt;possibility of establishing the true identity remains&lt;/span&gt;
]

--

.pull-right[
## Anonymization

**(GDPR Recital 26)**:

&gt; "information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable."


## With anonymization there is &lt;span style="color:#cc0065"&gt;no possibility of establishing the true identity&lt;/span&gt;
]

---

# What is enough?

- This is a question that **does not have a clear answer**.

--
- Consider the **risk-based approach** of GDPR.

--
- Technical and organizational measures (TOMs) aid you in keeping the risk at bay.

--
- If working with large datasets, consider means of **Statistical Disclosure Control** (e.g. k-anonymity).

--
- If you are uncertain, turn out to a **data management and legal expert**!!!

# Secure back-ups

.pull-left[
## Risks:
- Technical defects
- Catastrophes
- Theft
- Forgetfulness

## Strategies
- Storage on secure servers with automatic regular backup
- Backup important files in at least three copies on spatially separated data carriers

.pull-right[
## Backup setup (3-2-1 rule)
- At least **3** copies of a file
- On at least **2** different media
- At least **1** of which is remote

**Test data recovery at the beginning and at regular intervals**

## Protect your (sensitive) data:
- Hardware (e.g. separate lockable room)
- File encryption
- Password security
- At least two people should have access to your data
