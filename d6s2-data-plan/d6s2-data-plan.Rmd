# Personal data

Any data that enables you to **identify a person** is classified as personal data. In the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) personal data are .i-pink[any information relating to] an **identified** or **identifiable** natural person known as ‘a data subject’<sup>1</sup>.

.footnote[<sup>1</sup>The GDPR applies only to the data of living persons. Data which do not count as personal data do not fall under data protection legislation, though there might still be ethical reasons for protecting this information.]
--

.pull-left-wide[

## Sensitive personal data

Certain personal data can .i-pink[require specific protection] when they reveal information that may create important *risks* for the *fundamental rights* and *freedoms* of the involved individual. In the context of GDPR, these can be:

- Racial or ethnic origin;
- Political opinions;
- Religious or philosophical beliefs;
- Trade union membership;
- Genetic data;
- Biometric data;
- Data concerning health;
- Data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

## Research ethics

The moral **principles** and **actions** guiding and shaping research

<b style="color:#1D375B">In policy analysis</b> is closely linked to research ethics in the social sciences.
- Initially, a 'patient protection' model from medical research.
- Today it has a broader scope, including:
    - consideration of <i style="color:#cc0065">benefits, risks, and harms</i>
    - <i style="color:#cc0065">to all persons</i> connected with and affected by the research
- Gives **responsibilities** to researchers and analysts (e.g., *legal framework*).

# What is "data protection"?


.pull-left[
## Data protection

- Part of fundamental .i-pink[right to privacy] (or 'informational freedom’).
- In research there might be instances of tensions of fundamental rights:
    - Freedom of research vs. freedom of personal information.
- “Privacy is a personal condition of life characterized by seclusion from, and therefore absence of acquaintance by, the public” (Neethling 2005).
- **Core**:
    - prevention of unwanted disclosure of personal information or
    - the misuse of such information.

    - Increased requirement of voluntariness (Par4)
- More stringent for minors under 14 years of age (Art 8 GDPR).
- Important: Collection of "special categories" of personal data "prohibited" under Art 9 GDPR, unless there is a legal basis.

# Consent after the dact and the balance of interests

## "Balance of interest" - checklist: 

- Legitimate interest of the researcher?
- Is the data processing necessary?
    - Are the more lenient ways to achieve research goal?
- Can the subject refuse to the processing?
- Are these data linked (or linkable) to other data?
- How long will the data be stored?
- How many people are going to access the data?
- Are the research subjects from a vulnerable group?
- Would the research subjects have to expect the processing of their data?

# What is enough?

- This is a question that **does not have a clear answer**.

--
- Consider the **risk-based approach** of GDPR.

- Technical and organizational measures (TOMs) aid you in keeping the risk at bay.

- If working with large datasets, consider means of **Statistical Disclosure Control** (e.g. k-anonymity).
