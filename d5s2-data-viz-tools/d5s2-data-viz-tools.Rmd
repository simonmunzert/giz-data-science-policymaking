# Fundamental principles of analytic design

<br>
In Chapter 5 of his book "[Beautiful Evidence](http://atc.berkeley.edu/201/readings/Tufte_BE_2006.pdf)", Edward Tufte outlines six fundamental principles of analytic design:

--

1. **Comparisons.** Show <i style="color:#cc0065">comparisons</i>, <i style="color:#cc0065">contrasts</i>, <i style="color:#cc0065">differences</i>.

--

2. **Causality, mechanism, structure, explanation.** Show causality, mechanism, explanation, <i style="color:#cc0065">systematic structure</i>.

--

3. **Multivariate analysis.** Show data; that is show more than 1 or 2 variables (<i style="color:#cc0065">Use additional facets to add dimensions to the 2d plane</i>.)

--

4. **Integration of evidence.** Completely integrate <i style="color:#cc0065">words</i>, <i style="color:#cc0065">numbers</i>, <i style="color:#cc0065">images</i>, <i style="color:#cc0065">diagrams</i>.

--

5. **Documentation.** <i style="color:#cc0065">Thoroughly describe</i> the evidence. Provide a detailed title, indicate the authors and sponsors, document the data sources, show complete measurement scales, point out relevant issues.

--

6. **Content counts most of all.** Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance and integrity of their content ("What is the problem you want to solve?")

# Click- and code-based visualization tools

.pull-left[<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="../pics/d5-s2-tableau.png" height=150>
</div>

## Click-based

These tools are like .i-pink[easy-to-use apps] where you don't need to know how to code. You simply *click buttons*, *drag elements*, and *select options to create visualizations*. They're great if you want to quickly make charts and graphs without getting into the nitty-gritty of coding. Think of it like using a paint-by-numbers kit where you fill in colors without needing to mix them yourself.
]

--

.pull-right[<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="../pics/d5-s2-code-based.jpeg" height=150>
</div>

## Code-based
These are like toolkits for .i-pink[artists who prefer to paint from scratch]. Instead of clicking buttons, you write *instructions in a programming language* like `Python` or `R` to create your visualizations. This gives you a lot of **flexibility** and **control** over every detail of your chart or graph. It's like being able to mix your own colors and create any kind of painting you want, but it requires learning a bit of programming.

# Click-based visualization tools

.pull-left[
<br>
## Advantages

1. **Ease of Use:** Click-based tools like Tableau or Power BI offer .i-pink[intuitive interfaces] that make it easy for users to create visualizations without any programming knowledge.

2. **Rapid Prototyping:** Users can .i-pink[quickly prototype] and iterate on visualizations using click-based tools, enabling faster exploration of data and insights.

3. **Interactive Features:** Click-based tools often come with .i-pink[built-in interactive features] that allow users to explore data dynamically, such as filtering, drilling down, or zooming in on specific data points.

4. **Pre-built Templates:** Click-based tools often provide a variety of .i-pink[pre-built templates] and visualizations, saving users time and effort in design and formatting.

]

.pull-right[
<br>
## Disadvantages

1. **Limited Customization:** Click-based tools may have limitations in terms of customization compared to code-based tools, .i-pink[restricting] users' ability to create highly tailored visualizations.

2. **Scalability Issues:** Click-based tools may .i-pink[struggle with large datasets] or complex visualizations, leading to performance issues or limitations in functionality.

3. **Vendor Lock-in:** Users may become dependent on specific click-based tools, leading to vendor lock-in and potential .i-pink[limitations in flexibility or compatibility] with other tools.

4. **Cost:** Click-based tools often come with .i-pink[licensing fees or subscription costs], which can be prohibitive for individuals or organizations with budget constraints.

# Code-based visualization tools

.pull-left[
<br>
## Advantages

1. **Flexibility:** With code-based tools like `ggplot2`, users have .i-pink[full control] over customization, allowing them to create highly customized and intricate visualizations.

2. **Reproducibility:** Code-based tools facilitate reproducibility since the code can be shared and reused easily, ensuring .i-pink[consistent results across different environments].

3. **Scalability:** These tools are often more suitable for handling .i-pink[large datasets and complex visualizations], as they offer more advanced programming capabilities.

4. **Integration:** Code-based tools can be seamlessly .i-pink[integrated into data analysis workflows], allowing for direct manipulation of data and integration with statistical analysis.
]

--

.pull-right[
<br>
## Disadvantages

1. **Learning Curve:** Users without programming experience may find it .i-pink[challenging to learn] the syntax and concepts required to use code-based visualization tools effectively.

2. **Time-Consuming:** Creating visualizations from scratch using code can be .i-pink[time-consuming], especially for users who are not proficient in programming.

3. **Debugging Complexity:** Debugging code-based visualizations can be more .i-pink[complex] compared to click-based tools, especially when dealing with intricate plots or errors in the code.

4. **Maintenance:** Code-based visualizations may require more .i-pink[maintenance and updates over time], especially when libraries or dependencies change.

# Some notes on how to get visualization right

.pull-left[
1. **Always conceptualize first**.

2. Prioritize programmatic solutions to stay reproducible (i.e., <code>R</code> over Excel).

3. For conceptual charts (not: data viz!), other tools might be just fine (e.g., Powerpoint or even hand-drawn figures).

4. Don't be distracted by interactives (as offered by, e.g., highcharts.com, Tableau, and others).

5. Designing good graphs is a learnable skill. Study how others do it in your software of choice!

6. But a good visualization takes time, even if you’re experienced. Working a full day on the key plot of your analysis? No problem! If you go the coding route, this is a good investment for Future-You.

`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on *The Grammar of Graphics* (Leland Wilkinson).

- Coding a graphic requires us to describe each element of it very precisely.
- To do so, `ggplot` and its creator [Hadley Wickham](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25651297.pdf) build on and extend a particular grammar - the .hlred["Grammar of Graphics"] by [Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossmann](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532142).

# Components of grammar of graphics

| Element 	| Description 	| Essential? 	| Example 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Data 	| This is the dataset being plotted containing the variables to be plotted on the graph. 	| Yes 	| `ggplot(data = mpg)` 	|
| Aesthetics 	| Aesthetics refers to the scales on which we map our data. Some common aesthetics to consider are axis (x,y), shape, size and color.	|  Yes	| `aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)` 	|
| Geometries 	| Geom refers to the actual visual elements used for the data in the plot, such as points, lines, and bars. 	| Yes 	| `geom_point()` 	|
| Scales 	| Scales map data values to the visual values of an aesthetic. This can be used to change a default mapping 	| No 	| `scale_colour_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green"))` 	|
| Facets 	| Faceting refers to splitting the data into multiple subsets and then displaying plots for the specific subsets in a panel (small multiples). 	|  No	| `facet_grid(vars(drv), ncol = 1)` 	|
| Statistics 	| This refers to representing statistical information about the data, such as mean and variance, to help in understanding the data.	| No 	| `stat_count(geom="bar")` 	|
| Coordinates 	| This refers to the space on which the data is plotted (e.g., Cartesian coordinates). 	| No 	| `coord_polar()`	|
| Labels 	| This refers to additional descriptions of your plot, such as title, subtitle, caption, x and y axis label 	| No 	| `labs(x = "Height", y = "Weight", title = "Look at my plot")`	|
| Themes 	| Themes are used to change the appearance of non-data elements, such as fonts, color, or legends.	| No 	| `theme_bw()` 	|

# Picking the right image file format

.pull-left[
### What are the formats?
- At the end of the visualization workflow, you have to decide [how to store/export/publish the figures](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html).
- There are [many different file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats), but the most important difference is whether they are:
  - **Bitmap (raster graphics)**: store information as a grid of pixels
  - **Vector**: store information as geometric arrangement of individual graphical elements

### Which format to pick?
- Use `pdf/svg` whenever possible.
- Use `png` for online documents/presentations.
- Use `jpeg` as last resort (in particular if pngs are too large and loss by compression is acceptable).

# Going interactive

.pull-left-wide[
- In online presentations of your data and analyses, you might want to go interactive.
- Interactive webpages are mainly run with JavaScript, and we can use `R` to draw on JavaScript libraries to create interactive content.
- In particular, the `htmlwidgets` package provides a framework to bind `R` commands to various JavaScript libraries, including those that create data graphs.
- Many "widgets" are already available - check out http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/.
- Other JavaScript libraries for interactive graphics can be created with R, too:
  - [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to connect to the [Leaflet library](https://leafletjs.com/) and create interactive maps
  - [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) to connect to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/is-plotly-free/) and create graphs of all kinds
- For the record: interactive ≠ animated. On the right you see animated charts. Please don't do this at home.
