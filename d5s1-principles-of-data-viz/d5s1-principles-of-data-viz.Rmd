# Why data visualization?

### A new method for the policy toolbox

- Data visualization is a method for **making sense** (<i style="color:#cc0065">and not just pictures</i>) of data.
- Note that this is more than data visualization in the narrow sense, i.e. the act of <i style="color:#cc0065">encoding quantitative information</i> in visual objects.
- Decision-makers are mostly interested in <i style="color:#cc0065">patterns</i>, not individual and exact values.
- Two ways to make sense of quantitative information:

### The case for visualization

- Visualization **provides useful summaries** for large, complicated data sets – in fact, the utility of visualization increases with data size.
- Visualization **lets you see things** that would otherwise be invisible, in particular relationships among data (patterns, trends, exceptions). 
- Visualization comes with **little or no assumptions** about the nature of the data.
- Visualization facilitates interaction between researcher and data – **it’s a hypothesis generating device**.

<i> "The critical question is how best to transform the data into something that people can understand for optimal decision making." </i>

- One of the most famous data viusalizations of all times: [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow)'s cholera case map.
- The [Broad Street cholera outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak) in in Soho, London in 1854 was studied by physician John Snow to study its causes (rival hypotheses: germ-contaminated water vs. airborne transmission).
- The germ theory was not established at this point but the map helped highlight how cases clustered around a contaminated pump (which was by far not the only source of contaminated water though).
- Fun fact: this is what doing good data viz gives you:

### A tool for comparison

- "The fundamental analytical act in statistical reasoning is to answer the question 'compared to what?'
- Whether we are evaluating changes over space or time, searching big data bases, adjusting and controlling for variables, designing experiments, specifying multiple regressions, or doing just about any kind of evidence-based reasoning, the essential point is to make intelligent and appropriate comparisons.
- Thus visual displays, if they are to assist thinking, should show comparisons."

### Visualization as an iterative process

- The choice of the .i-pink[right graphical format ultimately depends on the task] or problem it is trying to solve.
- Always .i-pink[try different graphical formats] on the same data – they may reveal different aspects.
- Constructing visualizations is almost always an .hlred[iterative process] – the first graph is rarely also the final one.

### Human talent and weakness

- Humans are extremely good at recognizing patterns.
- At the same time, humans are also extremely good at inferring patterns when there are none (tendency to see patterns in random data = ".hlblue[apophenia]").
- This is somewhat linked to the fact that our species is bad at dealing with probability and randomness.

### Concerns with exploratory data analysis

- A concern that frequently arises with exploratory analysis is that it lacks the rigor of formal tests in confirmatory analysis or conventional statistical inference.
- Long-standing reservations against visualization as merely "informal" approach to data analysis and the fear that beautiful pictures may in fact not correspond to any meaningful patterns of substantive scientific interest.

# Visual inference (cont.)

.pull-left[
### Overcoming the exploratory vs. confirmatory visualization divide

- Graphical displays are implicit or explicit comparisons to a reference distribution or baseline model.
- If we discover an interesting pattern in data, this usually means that it looks different from what we expected.
- We usually have implicit models in our mind to which we compare the data ("What do we expect to see?").
- We can make these models explicit and use them to guard against "false discoveries".
- Visual discoveries correspond to the implicit or explicit rejection of null hypotheses ([Buja et al. 2009](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2009.0120)).

.pull-right[
### Visual inference as an analogue to null hypothesis significance testing

The basic principle of formal testing remains the same in visual inference – with the exception that the test statistic is now a graphical display which is compared to a "reference distribution" of plots showing the null:

# Visual inference: the line-up protocol

This method is called "after the 'police lineup' of criminal investigations [...], because it asks the witness to identify the plot of the real data from among a set of decoys, the null plots, under the veil of ignorance" ([Buja et al. 2009](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2009.0120)).

The visual hypothesis test involves the following steps:

  1. Simulate data to create $m-1$ null plots.
  2. Randomly place the plot of the real data among them, resulting in a total of $m$ plots.
  3. Ask a human viewer to choose the plot that looks the most different from the rest.
  4. If the test person succeeds and picks the plot showing the actual data, then this visual discovery can be assigned a p-value of $1/m$. In other words, the probability of picking the true plot just by chance is $1/m$.

# Mapping data onto aesthetics

- Whenever we visualize data, we .i-pink[take data values and convert them] in a systematic and logical way into the visual elements that make up the final graphic.

--
- Even though there are many .i-pink[different types of data visualizations], all these visualizations can be described with a .i-pink[common language].

--
- All data visualizations map data values into **quantifiable features** of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as .hlred[aesthetics].
- Key aesthetics are:

--
<div align="center">
<img src="../pics/d5-s1-aesthetics.png" width=450>

- All **aesthetics fall into one of two groups**: Those that can represent continuous data (e.g., position, size, color) and those that can not (e.g., shape, line type).

# Coordinate systems and axes

.pull-left-wide[
- .hlred[Positions of data values matter]. Usually, we need two position scales (x and y axis of the plot).
- The combination of a set of position scales and their relative geometric arrangement is called a **coordinate system**.
- Often we have two axes representing two different **units**. 
- In a **Cartesian** coordinate system, the grid lines along an axis are spaced evenly both in data units and in the resulting visualization.
- There are scenarios where nonlinear scales are preferred. In a nonlinear scale, even spacing in data units corresponds to uneven spacing in the visualization (e.g., log scales).
- Be sure to .hlblue[label axes properly]!

# Colors

.pull-left[
- There are **three fundamental use cases for color** in data visualizations:
  1. We can use color to distinguish groups of data from each other;
  2. We can use color to represent data values; and 
  3. We can use color to highlight.
- While colors are very powerful aesthetics, try to avoid common pitfalls, such as:
  - Encoding too much / irrelevant information
  - Using non-monotonic color scales to encode data values
  - Not designing for color-vision deficiency
- There's a whole **science around the perception of colors** in graphs, and a range of tools that help you select appropriate color schemes. My favorite is [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/), which is implemented in the [`RColorBrewer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html) package.

# Different plot types for different purposes

A common mistake in visualization is that .hlred[plot types are used for purposes they are not meant for]. You'll gain more intuition and experience in picking the right types over time. 

Before you start plotting, ask yourself:

--

.pull-left-vsmall[
#### 1. Which quantity do I want to visualize?

- Amounts
- Distributions
- Proportions
- Associations
- Structures
- Trends
- Estimates
- Predictions
- Uncertainty
]

--

.pull-right-vwide[
#### 2. Which question do I want to answer?

- "Is the *distribution* normal (or uniform or...)?" → **Histogram, density plot, Q-Q plot**
- "Are univariate *distributions* across subgroups different?" → **Boxplots, ridgelines**
- "How do *differences in amounts* between groups compare?" → **Barplot, dotplot** 
- "What is the *relationship* between x and y?" → **Scatterplot, contour plot, hex bins** 
- "What are the *correlations* in a set of variables?" → **Correlogram, small multiples** 
- "How did a *trend* develop over time?" → **Line graph, slopegraph** 
- "Are the data *clustered* by subgroup?" → **Scatterplot with color**
- "Is there a *spatial pattern*?" → **Choropleth, cartogram heatmap**
- "What are the relative and absolute *effect sizes*? → **Coefficient plot**
- "How uncertain are *estimates*? → **Error bars, confidence bands**

# Small multiples

.pull-left[
- A powerful yet underestimated visualization strategy is to use [multi-panel figures](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/multi-panel-figures.html).
- Often we want to compare relationships or trends between groups. With many groups, that's too much information for a single figure panel.
- There are various terms for multi-panel figures, including "small multiples" (Tufte 1990), "trellis plot" (Cleveland 1993) and "faceting" (Wickham 2016)
- In R we can implement this fairly easily with `ggplot`'s `facet_grid()` (or `facet_wrap()`).
- If you do small multiples, make sure to use:
  - common graph size
  - common axis scales
  - helpful alignment and order of panels

- What they did right (by Kaiser Fung):
  - Did not put the data on a map
  - Ordered the countries by the most recent data point rather than alphabetically
  - Scale labels are found only on outer edge of the chart area, rather than one set per panel
  - Only used three labels for the 11 years
  - Did not overdo the vertical scale either
  - The nicest feature was the XL scale applied only to South Korea. This destroys the small-multiples principle but draws attention to the top left corner, where the designer wants our eyes to go.
