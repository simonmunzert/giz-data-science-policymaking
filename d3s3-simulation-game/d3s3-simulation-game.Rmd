# Adversarial collaboration

.pull-center[
.content-box-gray-wide[
## Definition

.hlred[Adversarial collaboration] is a methodology where participants with **opposing views work together** to conduct studies, generally experiments, and **resolve their differences through empirical evidence**.
]
]

<br>
In this policy challenge, adversarial collaboration will serve as a **modality of collaboration where opposing views work together** in order to jointly advance knowledge of the policy area under dispute. 

This will take the form of the development of a .hlblue[joint plan] conducted by the two groups with competing theories of change.

The aim is to **construct and implement a design that satisfies both groups** to assess the potential goals of the policies.

# Group work: Normative case (14:30-14:45)

.content-box-gray-wide[
.hlred[Objective]: Establish the fundamental **ethical, moral, and societal values that support the policy**.
]


## Subtasks:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Policy**: Understand the key components, goals, and implications of the policy you are meant to defend.
2. **Articulate the Normative Justification**: Identify and explain the ethical, moral, and societal values that underpin the need for your policy. Why is it the right thing to do?
3. **Compare to Rival Policy**: Analyze and articulate why your policy is morally or ethically preferable to the rival policy.
4. **Identify Key Measures**: Highlight 2-3 key concrete measures that your policy would entail, explaining how they serve the normative goals.
5. **Summarize in a Presentation Pitch**: Prepare a concise presentation (7 minutes max) summarizing your normative case. Visual aids are optional but can be used to enhance clarity.


## You will pitch these from 14:45 to 15:15


---

# Group work: Evidence-based case (15:15-15:45)


.content-box-gray-wide[
.hlred[Objective]: Support your policy with robust insights, making a **evidence-driven argument**.
]

## Subtasks:

1. **Conduct Research**: Gather relevant data, studies, and expert opinions that support your policy. Focus on credible and up-to-date sources.
2. **Analyze Avaiable Information**: Critically analyze the information to draw meaningful conclusions that support your policy goals.
3. **Link Evidence to Policy Goals**: Clearly explain how the evidence supports the specific measures and overall goals of your policy.
4. **Compare with Rival Policy**: Use evidence to highlight the strengths of your policy and the weaknesses or gaps in the rival policy.
5. **Prepare a Evidence-Driven Pitch**: Develop a presentation that integrates the evidence into your argument. You can include studies, cases, charts, graphs, and other aids as needed.


## You will pitch these from 16:00 to 16:30

# Adversarial collaboration (16:30-17:00)

.content-box-gray-wide[
.hlred[Objective]: Critically **examine and refine policies** through structured **debate** and **collaboration with opposing groups**.
]

## Subtasks:

1. **Form Mixed Teams**: Create small teams consisting of members from both policy groups to foster direct engagement.
2. **Exchange Arguments**: Present your policy arguments to the opposing group and listen to their arguments.
3. **Identify Common Ground**: Look for areas of agreement or shared goals between the two policies.
4. **Debate Key Issues***: Engage in structured debate to challenge assumptions, question evidence, and refine arguments.
5. **Collaborate on Refinements**: Work together to identify potential compromises or improvements to the policies based on the debate.
6. **Document Outcomes**: Summarize the key points of agreement, disagreement, and any proposed refinements or compromises.

# Policy design presentation (17:00-17:30)

.content-box-gray-wide[
.hlred[Objective]: Deliver a final, polished **presentation that clearly communicates the policy design**, supported by normative arguments and evidence.
]

## Subtasks:

1. **Regroup and Share**: Gather your team to discuss insights and feedback from the adversarial collaboration session. Share notes, refine ideas, and ensure everyone is aligned on the final policy design.
2. **Finalize Policy Design**: Integrate feedback from the adversarial collaboration session to finalize your policy design.
3. **Structure the Presentation**: Organize the presentation to include an introduction, normative arguments, evidence-based support, and a conclusion.
4. **Deliver the Presentation**: Present your policy design to the entire workshop group, ensuring each team member is prepared to address questions and engage in discussion.
5. **Q&A Session**: Prepare for a question-and-answer session following the presentation to address any queries and defend your policy.
