# Simulation: Solving policy challenges with evidence 

## Organizers

Simon Munzert, Sebastian Ramirez-Ruiz

## Summary

In this interactive session, participants are confronted with a policy challenge. In teams, they have to evaluate and present evidence on the impact of several policy options, applying the skills and tools they have learned in the previous sessions. Based on this, they develop an evaluation design to optimize findings on the desired and undesired effects of the policy and incorporate them into decisions in the policy-making process.

| Policy Plan | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| ðŸš² Policy Plan 1: Prioritizing Bike Infrastructure for Urban Areas | This policy aims to enhance urban mobility and sustainability by significantly expanding and prioritizing bike infrastructure. The policy focuses on creating a network of safe, accessible, and connected bike lanes and facilities throughout urban areas. It seeks to reduce traffic congestion, lower carbon emissions, improve public health, and enhance the overall quality of life in cities. |
| ðŸ”‹ Policy Plan 2: Prioritizing Car Infrastructure + Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles | This policy aims to modernize urban transportation by prioritizing the development of car infrastructure, with a particular focus on supporting the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The policy addresses the need for robust car infrastructure while also encouraging the adoption of cleaner, more sustainable EVs through extensive charging networks and supportive policies. |
