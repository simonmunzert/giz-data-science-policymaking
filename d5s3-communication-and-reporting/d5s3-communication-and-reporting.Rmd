# Lasswell model of communication **for DS**   

Laswell's framework of communication<sup>1</sup> dissects the task of communication along the following dimensions: (1) Who communicates (2) what (3) in what form (4) to whom (5) to what effect?

Let's apply this to us. Data scientists communicate...

# Statistical communication

.pull-left[
### <b>What</b> we communicate
- The quantity of interest
- The selection/generation of data
- The empirical setup
- The model mechanics and results (estimates/predictions/uncertainty)

### Common challenges
- There's epistemological and statistical uncertainty.
- Effect sizes have implications that are often not easy to grasp.
- Conclusions about data science output crucially hinge on the validity of design aspects, which are extremely difficult to communicate.

# Uncertainty

### What we are uncertain about

- **Measurement** â†’ uncertainty in single variables
- **Model specification** â†’ uncertainty across multiple variables and how they connect
- **Parameter estimates** â†’ uncertainty about bias and precision
- **Model outcomes** â†’ uncertainty about (out-of-sample) fit
- **Generalizability** to other samples, the future

Depending on the empirical setup, various specific **sources of error** might enter (e.g., [survey data](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/74/5/849/1817502), [digital trace data](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/85/S1/399/6359490)).

# Communicating uncertainty

- The concept is **complex**. Not all people think in probabilistic terms.
- **Many humans are bad at understanding (conditional and unconditional) probabilities**.
- Adding **information about uncertainty might distract**, confuse, and undermine trust.

# Programmatic solutions for communicating

.pull-left[

### Open-source software can help

- R Markdown (and the `rmarkdown` package) helps you create dynamic analysis documents that combine code, rendered output (such as figures), and prose. 
- You can use it to
  - Do data science interactively with notebooks.
  - Modify the layout of your report.
  - Communicate your results with others.
- You take care of content, R Markdown of format.

### More resources

- The [official website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- The [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
- [R Markdown - The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
]

--

.pull-right[

### The possibilities for communicating in data sicence workflows are immense

- R Markdown can do much more than reports. You can use it to author
  - Reports (in PDF, HTML, Word, etc.)
  - Interactive documents
  - Dashboards
  - Slideshows
  - Books
  - Websites
- It stands on the shoulders of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a program that converts markup files into virtually any other format.

# The next generation of technical publishing: Quarto

.pull-left-wide[

### What's Quarto?

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is software developed at [Posit](https://posit.co/), the company behind RStudio. 
- It's the "next generation of R Markdown" and also built on Pandoc. If you know R Markdown well, you already know Quarto well.
- It facilitates embedding code and output from R, Python, Julia, and other languages.
- It combines the functionality of R Markdown and all the other tools (bookdown, xaringan, etc.) into one single consistent system.
- Quarto is still fairly new and under active development. More and more [extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) are coming out that increase the flexibility of the suite.
- Check out the comprehensive [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) to learn more.

### Quarto and Jupyter

- Quarto's support for both Knitr and Jupyter means that you can use it to create documentation projects that contain content from both systems.
- Something to keep in mind next semester and going forward! :)

### Yeah, what are they really?
- A (business or data) [dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business) is a GUI that provides high-level overviews of performance indicators or other quantities of interest. 
- It's a **monitoring** (and not so much analysis) **tool**.

# The problem(s) with dashboards

.pull-left[
## Design challenges

- **They say too little.** Loss of information is [fatal](https://stephanieevergreen.com/problem-with-dashboards/) for good decision-making when aggregating results into few KPIs.
- **They say too much** (irrelevant things). 
- Dashboards often fail not in technology but in communication (rooted in poor design).
- "Dashboards are not for show. No amount of cuteness and technical wizardry can substitute for clear communication." [Stephen Few](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i247s12/files/2012/01/Dashboard-Design-Overview-Presentation.pdf), [Perceptual Edge](https://perceptualedge.com)
- Dashboards are a subgenre of data viz, so **all rules of good/bad viz apply**.
- So, there is hope since we do know a bit about how to design good visuals. (See [here](https://stephanieevergreen.com/dashboard-conversation/) for a nice case study on improving the design of a dashboard.)
]

--

.pull-right[
## Analytic challenges

- Dashboards cater to the desire to be able to make good decisions on the basis of few selected metrics.
- This logic reflects a **gross simplification of reality**. 
- All challenges that pop up in careful analytic work - issues of selection, measurement, causality, predictiveness - are still valid but will be obscured when aggregating data. 
- Simple metrics can still be useful, but often **you need contextual knowledge** (which is difficult to communicate in dashboards).
- Another consequence of "dashboarding" business intelligence can be that by making decisions a function of metrics, they stop working well because they will be gamed.

### <tt>flexdashboard</tt> package
- Overview [here](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard).
- Good for easy dashboard building
- Just a document that looks like a dashboard
- Can be compiled into a static file (just like regular Markdown)
- Can only run interactive code client-fleside (in embedded JavaScript)
- Shiny  and `htmlwidgets` (`leaflet`, `plotly`, `highcharter`, etc.)  can be integrated (with all the up- and downsides)

- Overview [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
- More complex to program, but the best option for complex apps.
- Can implement any layout.
- Needs a server behind it to execute R code on user input. 
- Can run interactive code either by processing serverside (in R) or clientside (in embedded JavaScript).
- The [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) package provides another way to create dashboards with Shiny.

# Developing reporting media

**Ask yourselves:** .hlred[What timeframe, format, and type of learning is required for reporting?]


## Media for group learning <span style="color:#cc0065">(Traditionally)</span>

# Ensuring accessibility

**Ask yourselves:** .hlred[How can this information be easy to access and use for different users?]

--

- .hlred[Use appropriate language]: Make sure the language of a report is clear, concise and allows accessibility for all consumers. **AVOID UNNECESSARY JARGON**.

--

- .hlred[Apply graphic design principles]

--

- .hlred[Use simplified report layouts]: Three different ways of simplifying the report layouts are to eliminate chartjunk, emphasise headings as summary statements, and use descriptive subtitles.

--

- In evaluation reports, think of the .hlred[One-Three-Twenty-Five (1:3:25) principle]: Present findings in a logical and consistent manner by allowing *roughly* for a 1 page outline, a 3 page executive summary and 25 pages to present the findings and methodology.

--

- .hlred[Beware of the inclusiviy of your medium]: Think of users with auditory or visual disabilities.
