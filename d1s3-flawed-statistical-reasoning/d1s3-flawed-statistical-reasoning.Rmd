# Samples and representativity

.pull-left[
## A folk definition of representativity

A sample (or data in general) is "representative" if **conclusions drawn from the sample can be generalized** to the population of interest.
]

.pull-right[
## A more formal definition

A sample is representative if it is drawn in such a way that it is **statistically indistinguishable** from the population of interest.

# The issue with the term "representativity"

## Why "representativity" is a problematic term

1. Whether a sample is representative depends on your interest.
2. You cannot call a sample "representative" a priori. 
3. Assessing the representativity of a sample requires strong assumptions about your knowledge on the population (but where does it come from?) and your measures of characteristics which should be "representative".

# Total survey error

.pull-left[
## Inference in survey research

- Learn something about the distribution of attributes in a population
- Collect information from  a subset of the population

## Two types of errors

- Errors of **measurement**: what you measure is not what you want to measure
- Errors of **representation**: the set of whom you observe is not generalizable to the population of interest

# Measurement and sampling error in the wild

## Overrepresentation and misreporting in election surveys

- Figures from postelection surveys often grossly overestimate election turnout. 
- Two distinct phenomena are responsible for this gap:
    1. Overrepresentation of actual voters
    2. Vote misreporting by actual nonvoters among survey respondents. 
- Vote validation studies help identify the issue at the individual level.
- Turnout bias can also affect analyses of downstream variables (e.g., voting behavior).

# Bad sampling: lessons learned


.pull-left[
## What does this mean for you?

- Don't take reported "representativity" at face value.
- Sample size alone does not guarantee representativity.
- Don't be fooled by "big data" (it's not representative by default).
- Don't be fooled by "convenience samples" (they are not representative by default).
- Probability sampling is not a panacea because people still self-select into/out of samples.
- Bad sampling is not restricted to surveys (think, e.g., about social media data, case selection for a medical trial, or selection of countries for a policy study).
]

.pull-right[
## Instead, look for the following: 

1. **Transparency** about the sampling process.
2. **Assessment** of the representativity of the sample.
3. **Validation** of the sample against external benchmarks.
4. **Common sense** (does it make sense to call the representative?)

# Back to statistical significance

.pull-left[
## Statistical significance in practice
- By convention, Type I errors should be avoided at all cost
- A result is regarded statistically significant when it is very unlikely to have occurred under a true null hypothesis
- A significance level $\alpha$ gives the probability of Type I error. Commonly set to 5%
]

--

.pull-right[
## Some problems
- Just because an effect is significant does not mean it is substantively meaningful (large).
- There is an incentive for researchers to produce statistically significant findings. $\rightarrow$ publication bias
- Statistical significance is (also) a function of sample size. It is **trivial to generate significant findings with big data**.
- Unfortunately, it's also often **trivial to generate significant findings with small data** when you are flexible with regards to your hypotheses.

# Fishing and p-hacking

.pull-left-wide2[
## The problem

The dominance of statistical significance as decision criterion in the scientific publishing game makes p-values a key target criterion in statistical analysis. Small p-values are reported more often than we'd expect!

## The symptoms

- **Fishing**: testing many hypotheses until significance
- **P-hacking**: tweaking your analysis (e.g., adding/removing controls, transforming variables, changing models) until significance
- **HARKing**: **H**ypothesizing **a**fter the **r**esults are **k**nown

## The cure?

# The effect of pre-registration

.pull-left[
## The idea

- Pre-registration implies registering (e.g., by putting it online) your study (hypotheses, methods, analyses) before it is conducted
- Major change in research practice over the last years; check out the [Open Science Framework (OSF) Registry](https://osf.io/registries/osf/new) and  the [American Economic Association (AEA) RCT Registry](https://docs.socialscienceregistry.org/)


## Why this matters

> "17 of 30 studies (57\%) published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2 among the 25 (8\%) trials published after 2000." (see plot)

# Statistical power

.pull-left[
## The concept
- We are used to guard against false positives (significance tests!), but false negatives can hurt, too – in particular if a study/experiment was very costly to run
- Statistical power is the **probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false**
- The ability to distinguish signal from noise, where the signal is the treatment effect of interest
- P("There is an effect and I see it"): Power = 1 - Type II error
- The higher the statistical power for an experiment, the lower the probability of a Type II error

# Power analysis

.pull-left-wide2[
## Motivation
- Is your sample big enough to uncover an effect of a certain size? Run a power analysis (ideally before data collection)!
- [Power analysis](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-statistical-power/) is the process of determining the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given sample size
- If you can afford it, adapt sample size and/or design on the basis of your power calculations

## Calculation
- Multiple power formulas for different experimental (and observational) designs
- Formula can be rearranged to, e.g., determine $N$
- Many off-the-shelf power calculators out there, e.g. [here](https://egap.shinyapps.io/power-app/) (explainer [here](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/research-resources/ExerciseC_PowerCalc_Participants.pdf))
- In practice, doing power analyses requires you to make more or less strong assumptions about effect size 
]

.pull-right-small2[
## Formula

Power calculation for two-group difference-in-means test with equal variances and group sizes:

$\text{power} = \Phi(\frac{|\mu_{t}-\mu_{c}|\sqrt{N}}{2\sigma}-\Phi^{-1}(1-\frac{\alpha}{2}))$

- $\Phi$ is the CDF of the Normal distribution $\rightarrow$ power assumed to follow the Normal
- $\mu_{t,c}$ is the average outcome in treatment/control group $\rightarrow$ effect
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of outcomes $\rightarrow$ noisiness
- $\alpha$ is chosen significance level, often 0.05 by convention
- $N$ is the total number of subjects

# Power analysis: example

.pull-left[
## Example
- You want to detect a 5% increase in voter turnout due to a new campaign
- You have a sample of 500 voters
- Assume a standard deviation of 20% in voter turnout
- Assume a significance level of 0.05
- What is the power of your study?
- Use e.g., [EGAP calculator](https://egap.shinyapps.io/power-app/)

## Calculation
- $\mu_{t}-\mu_{c} = 0.05$
- $\sigma = 0.2$
- $N = 500$
- $\alpha = 0.05$
- Power = ?

# Bad analytics: lessons learned

## Checklist

- **Check the evidence.** Is it really statistically significant?
- **Look at the theory and evidence.** Is it plausible?
- **Look at the design.** Can you spot any major flaws?
- **Look at the effect size.** Is it meaningful? Is it too good to be true?
- **Look at the sample size.** Is it reasonably large? Is the study well-powered?
- **Check whether the study was pre-registered.** Spot ad-hoc hypotheses.
- **Don't trust any single study.** Look for meta-analyses!

# The math of correlation, explained

.pull-left[
## The Pearson correlation coefficient

- Measures the **strength and direction** of a **linear relationship** between two variables
- Ranges from -1 to 1
- Formula to compute it:

$r_{xy} = \frac{\text{covariation of X and Y}}{\text{separate variation of X and Y}} = \frac{Cov(x, y)}{s_x s_y} = \sum_i \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_x s_y}$
 ]
 

.pull-right[
## Pearson's r is...

- positive when variables A and B increase together
- negative when A[B] increases and B[A] decreases
- 1 when A and B increase together perfectly
- -1 when A increases and B decreases perfectly
- 0 when A and B don't covary

# Correlation does not imply causation

.pull-left[
## Correlation

Two variables are **correlated** when knowing the value of one gives you information about the likely value of the other.

## Causation

Two events are **causally related** when the occurrence of one is a result of the occurrence of another.

## The causal fallacy

Two variables that are correlated are not necessarily in a cause-and-effect relationship.

# So, what does it imply when variables A and B are correlated?

## Some possible explanations

- A causes B (direct causation)
- B causes A (reverse causation)
- A and B are consequences of a common cause (confounding)
- A causes C which causes B (mediation)
- A and B both cause C which is conditioned on (collider bias)
- There is no connection between A and B, the empirical correlation is a coincidence (spurious correlation)

## How to distinguish between these?

- **Experimental designs** (randomized controlled trials)
- **Natural experiments** (quasi-experiments)
- **Observational data** (careful analysis of confounders and colliders)
- **Common sense** (does it make sense that A causes B?)
- **Rival explanations** (can we rule out other explanations?)

We'll look into those strategies tomorrow.

2. Do we have evidence to rule out other rival explanations?
3. Is the evidence built on a clean experimental design?

5. In the absence of (quasi-)experiments, is the evidence built on a careful analysis of observational data, taking care of plausible confounders and colliders?
