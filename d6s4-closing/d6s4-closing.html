# What is data science?

.pull-left[
## What is data science?

&gt; "Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

&gt; "Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data." - [Chikio Hayashi](https://www.springer.com/book/9784431702085)

Overall, there's **no consensus** - it is a buzzword after all. We're going to carry on with Conway's working definition.

# Types of data-driven research and their role for policy

.pull-left-small2[
## 1. Description
- What is the state of the world?
- What are the trends over time?
- What are the differences between groups?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **monitoring**
- "How many people consume misinformation online?"
- "How many people are unemployed in a certain district?"
- "How does the distribution of income vary across educational segments of the population?"
]

--

.pull-left-small2[
## 2. Explanation
- What is the effect of a policy?
- Does the effect vary across groups?
- What are the mechanisms behind the effect?

## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **evaluation**
- "Did the minimum wage increase lead to a decrease in employment?"
- "Did the campaign affect the exposure to misinformation differently across groups?"
- "Why did the intervention not lead to the expected results?"
]

--

.pull-left-small2[
## 3. Prediction
- What is the path of an indicator?
- (When) will future events happen?
- What class does this observation most likely belong to?


## The value for policy-making
- At the center of **forecasting** but also **targeting** and **measurement**
- "Will there be conflict?"
- "How many people will be unemployed in a certain district next year?"
- "Which individuals are most likely to be affected by a policy?"
]

# Calling out bad evidence when you see it

.pull-left-small[

## 1. Learn not to be fooled by 

- big data
- garbage data
- garbage models
- weird samples
- claims of generality
- statistical significance
- implausibly large effect sizes
- highly precise forecasts
- overfitted models


## 2. Consume policy-relevant evidence effectively and efficiently

## 3. Apply elements of data science to policy-making

# What we're not going to cover

.pull-left-small2[
## Programming
- Python, R, SQL, etc. skills are essential for data science
- The learning curve is steep and requires practice
- We're happy to provide a glimpse behind the curtain if that is of interest, and provide additional resources
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="../pics/programming-logos.jpeg" height=150&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
]

.pull-left-small2[
## Active modeling
- Building designs and models - explanatory and predictive - requires more theoretical and practical knowledge than we can cover in this workshop
- Focusing on the principles of statistical and causal reasoning should be sufficient to critically assess designs and models
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="../pics/modeling-picture.jpeg" height=150&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
]

.pull-right-small2[
## Advanced machine learning, NLP
- ML, DL, NLP are technologies that drive many of the most exciting applications of data science
- Understanding what happens under the hood requires a solid foundation in math and stats
- We will focus on fundamental elements of ML-based research
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

# Descriptive vs. inferential statistics

.pull-left[
## Descriptive statistics
- Summarize and describe characteristics of a sample or population
- Can be communicated numerically and visually
- Different scales (levels of measurement) require different descriptive statistics
- Good description can be challenging if data collection or measurement is complex
]

.pull-right[
## Inferential statistics
- Make inferences about a population based on a sample
- Can be inferences about means, proportions, relationships, etc.
- Can be communicated numerically and visually
- Good description is the basis for good inference

# Measures of central tendency


.pull-left[
## Three popular measures of central tendency

- **(Arithmetic) Mean**: The **average** of all values in a dataset
- **Median**: The **middle** value of a dataset
- **Mode**: The **most frequent** value in a dataset

Why "central tendency"? Describes the tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value.

## Try it out

Identify the mode, median, and mean of the following values:

8, 2, 4, 2, 18, 6, 2
]

--

.pull-right[
## Which one to use?

- **Mean**: Sensitive to outliers, but with an intuitive meaning
- **Median**: Robust to outliers, but a bit less intuitive
- **Mode**: Useful for categorical data, but can be misleading for continuous data

## Skewed distributions

# Samples and representativity

.pull-left[
## A folk definition of representativity

A sample (or data in general) is "representative" if **conclusions drawn from the sample can be generalized** to the population of interest.
]

.pull-right[
## A more formal definition

A sample is representative if it is drawn in such a way that it is **statistically indistinguishable** from the population of interest.

- The POF assumes that each subject has a **potential outcome under both treatment states**
- Evidently, .i-pink[each subject can only be observed in one treatment state at any point in time]
- Therefore, the individual treatment effect is a non-observable counterfactual ("the fundamental problem of causal inference", Holland 1986)
- The idea is to think about the **counterfactual** outcome that would have been observed had the treatment been different

### Let's define a couple of key mathematical notions with an example.

## Potential outcomes under treatment and control

- Assume we have a binary treatment variable `\(X\)` (e.g., blind-review practices)
- We observe the outcome `\(Y\)` (e.g., number of women hired)
- The potential outcomes are `\(Y(1)\)` and `\(Y(0)\)`

| **Group/Firm** | No. of women (under treatment) |  No. of women (under control) |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Has blind-review practices| Observable as `\(Y\)` | Counterfactual |
| No blind-review practices | Counterfactual | Observable as `\(Y\)` |

## The fundamental problem of causal inference

- Why is the causal effect of X on Y not simply the difference between the upper-left and lower-right cell in the table?
- We can only observe one of the two potential outcomes!
- Causal inference implies answering **'What if'** questions, i.e. imagine a counterfactual world in which the treatment was different for a given unit

- The .i-pink[average treatment effect (ATE)] is the average of everyone's individual treatment effect (ITE). In this case:
    - `\(= \frac{(-1)+(-2)+0+1+(-2)+0+(-1)+1}{8}\)`
    - `\(= \frac{(-4)}{8}\)`
    - `\(= -0.5\)`
    
- The actual effect of the blind-review policy is an **expected reduction of 0.5 women hired on average** 🤔.

--
- A path is **open** or unblocked **at non-colliders** (confounders or mediators)

- A path is (naturally) **blocked at colliders**

- An **open path induces statistical association** between two variables

&gt; [Study author Dianna Kenny] found that musicians from older genres – including blues, jazz, country and gospel – have similar lifespans to American people their own age. The life expectancy for R&amp;B musicians is slightly lower, while the life expectancy for newer genres like rock, techno, punk, metal, rap and hip hop is significantly shorter."

## Some issues

1. **Sanity check:** Are some genres really that deadly? E.g., do rap musicians really die at an average age of ~30?
2. **Right censoring:** Some genres are younger than others and the data are conditional on musicians having died already. Most rap and hip-hop stars are still alive today; we don't know how long they'll live!
3. **Conditional probabilities:** The probabilities of each cause of death are conditional on death having already occurred at the time of the study.
4. (Minor issue) A line graph for categorical data?  [Not a good idea.](https://www.jmp.com/en_gb/statistics-knowledge-portal/exploratory-data-analysis/line-graph.html#:~:text=Line%20graphs%20do%20not%20make,might%20have%20a%20defined%20order.)

## Data mining

&gt; "Application of machine learning methods to large databases is called data mining. The analogy is that a large volume of earth and raw material is extracted from a mine, which when processed leads to a small amount of very precious material; similarly, in data mining, a large volume of data is processed to construct a simple model with valuable use, for example, having high predictive accuracy."

# A general overview of evidence

--

.pull-center[
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Evidence:** *facts*, *signs* or *objects* that are used to prove whether something is true or not.
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-gray[
Evidence can be made up of a range of components – *not only scientific* – and is never used in isolation. Scientific evidence typically [relies on] surveys, quantitative/statistical data, qualitative data, and [the] analysis thereof. However, evidence also includes economic, attitudinal, behavioural and anecdotal [insight], together with … experience, history, analogies, local knowledge and culture &lt;a name=cite-strydom2010evidence&gt;&lt;/a&gt;([Strydom et al., 2010](#bib-strydom2010evidence))

# What is evidence-based policy-making?


.pull-center[
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Evidence-based policy-making:** the process of generating policy &lt;i style="color:#cc0065"&gt;backed up&lt;/i&gt; by a solid&lt;br&gt;body of &lt;i style="color:#cc0065"&gt;scientific research&lt;/i&gt; or derived from or informed by &lt;i style="color:#cc0065"&gt;objective evidence&lt;/i&gt;.
]

.content-box-gray[
*Evidence-based policymaking* involves utilizing *high-quality information* to guide decisions regarding government policies. This process entails *systematically* collecting robust data and analyzing them with *rigorous* research methods to generate reliable evidence. Such evidence can offer .i-pink[insights] into the .i-pink[effectiveness] of policies and programs, operational mechanisms, and .i-pink[performance] trends over time.

# When is knowledge used?

.pull-center[
&lt;br&gt;
A key concern for us is to establish whether evidence will be, or is, .i-pink['used'], but what does '**using evidence**'&lt;br&gt;actually mean? And, how can evidence go on and .i-pink[inform policy decisions]?
]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


.content-box-gray-wide[

Largely, research has conceptualized **knowledge use** under three larger "buckets":

- .i-pink[Instrumental] use to facilitate **decision making**.
- .i-pink[Conceptual] use to facilitate **understanding** or reflection on problems; issues or solutions.
- .i-pink[Symbolic or tactical] use consisting of using evidence to achieve **strategic** or **political objectives**.]



---
class: midtext

# When is knowledge used? (cont.)

- **Knowledge-driven model:** Think of use of evidence as a sequential process. The notion is that some new knowledge discloses some opportunity that may have relevance for public policy. (*Basic research -&gt; Applied research -&gt; Development -&gt; Application*)

- **Problem-solving model:** A problem exists and a decision has to be made, information or understanding is lacking either to generate a solution to the problem or to select among alternative solutions, .i-pink[research provides the missing knowledge]. With the gap filled, a decision is reached. (*Application of evidence to pending decisions*)

- **Interactive model:** A dynamic process where multiple stakeholders make sense of a problem with their talents, beliefs, and understandings. The use of evidence is .i-pink[only one part of a complicated process] that also uses experience, political insight, pressure, social technologies, and judgment.

- **Political model:** Actors with predetermined positions. Evidence can still be used. It becomes .i-pink[ammunition] for the side that finds its conclusions congenial and supportive.

- **Tactical model:** Evidence is not used for its substance, but to show that .i-pink[something was done]. Evidence is used as proof of responsiveness, tactic for delaying action, deflecting criticism, or enhancing agency prestige. (*People seem to agree this matters, so we may as well integrate it in some way*)

- **Enlightment model:** Scientific research and evaluation concepts and perspectives shape policy indirectly. They sensitize decision-makers to new issues and changes policy agendas. It is not the findings of a single study nor even of a body of related studies that directly affect policy. Rather it is the .i-pink[concepts and theoretical perspectives] that permeate the policy-making process.

# Mapping science onto policy

&lt;br&gt;
.content-box-gray-wide[
According to the &lt;a name=cite-national2012using&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[National Research Council (2012)](#bib-national2012using), science can have five tasks related to policy: 

1. .i-pink[identify problems], such as endangered species, obesity, unemployment, and vulnerability to natural disasters or terrorist acts; 
2. .i-pink[measure] their magnitude and seriousness; 
3. .i-pink[review] alternative policy interventions; 
4. systematically assess the .i-pink[likely consequences] of particular policy actions—intended and unintended, desired and unwanted; and 
5. .i-pink[evaluate] what, in fact, results from policy. 
]

.pull-center[&lt;br&gt;
Through **data science**, we can leverage large, often under-used, data sources and tap&lt;br&gt;on their full potential to extract policy insights related to each of those tasks.]

# Use with care

## Limitations of AI tools

- **Quality of Data Input:** AI tools heavily rely on the quality and relevance of the data inputted. If the initial data used to train the AI model is biased or incomplete, it can affect the accuracy of the results generated by the tool. (**Garbage in/garbage out**)
- **Limited Contextual Understanding:** AI tools may lack the ability to understand the broader context of a research topic or the specific needs of a policymaker. This can lead to oversights or inaccuracies in the synthesis of evidence.
- **Inability to Handle Ambiguity:** AI tools may struggle with ambiguity or uncertainty present in research literature. They may not effectively handle conflicting findings or nuanced interpretations, which are common in complex policy areas.
- **Risk of Overlooking Unconventional Sources:** AI tools often prioritize well-established sources and may overlook valuable insights from non-traditional or emerging sources of evidence, such as preprints, grey literature, or community reports.
- **Difficulty in Adapting to Rapidly Evolving Fields:** In fast-paced fields where new research emerges frequently, AI tools may struggle to keep pace with the latest developments and may not provide up-to-date synthesis of evidence.

---

# Use with care (cont.)

## Limitations of AI tools

- **Lack of Transparency:** Some AI algorithms operate as black boxes, meaning they lack transparency in how they arrive at their conclusions. This can make it challenging for users to understand and interpret the rationale behind the recommendations or results provided by the tool.
- **Dependency on Technical Skills:** Using AI tools often requires a certain level of technical proficiency, including understanding how to interpret and adjust algorithm parameters. This can create barriers for users who lack the necessary skills or training.
- **Cost and Accessibility:** Some AI-powered tools may come with significant costs or subscription fees, making them inaccessible to users with limited budgets or resources, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
- **Ethical Considerations:** AI tools may inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the data or algorithm design, leading to unintended consequences such as reinforcing existing disparities or overlooking marginalized voices.
- **Human Oversight and Validation Required:** Despite the automation provided by AI tools, human oversight and validation are still essential to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and ethical integrity of the synthesized evidence.
- .hlred[LLMs tend to hallucinate sources]

# The case for data visualization in policy

- .hlred[Enhanced comprehension and communication]
    - **Simplifier of complex data**: Data visualizations can transform complex datasets into clear, understandable visuals, making it easier for policymakers and stakeholders to grasp intricate information quickly.
    - **Improved communication**: Visuals can bridge communication gaps between technical and non-technical audiences, leveling the accessibility of insights to relevant parties.
--
- .hlred[Facilitator for decision-making]
    - **Trend and pattern identification**: Visual representations can highlight trends, patterns, and anomalies that may not be evident in raw data.
    - **Transparency**: Clear visualizations can help demonstrate the basis for policy decisions.
--
- .hlred[Engagement and participation]
    - **Stakeholder inclusion**: Interactive and visually appealing data presentations can capture the interest of stakeholders, encouraging more active participation in the policy-making process.
    - **Increased understanding**: Well-designed visualizations can educate and inform the public about policy issues, leading to greater awareness and support for policy initiatives.
--
- .hlred[Resource allocation]
    - **Priority setting**: Visual data can help policymakers identify key areas that require attention and allocate resources more effectively and efficiently.
    - **Progress tracking**: Data visualizations can be used to monitor the implementation of policies and measure their changes over time, allowing for adjustments and improvements.

# The case for data visualization in policy (cont.)

- .hlred[Accountability and transparency]
    - **Reporting**: Designing visualizations make the design of a communication strategy explicit.
    - **Comparison and contrasts**: Visual data can be useful to expose disparities and inequities within groups, prompting action to address these issues.
--
- .hlred[Streamlined processes]
    - **Collaboration**: Visual tools can help different departments and agencies understand each other's data and collaborate more effectively on cross-cutting policy issues.
    - Data harmonization: Visualizations can integrate data from multiple sources, providing a comprehensive view that supports cohesive policy strategies.
--
- .hlred[Computational developments]
    - **Government data**: The increasing availability of large datasets necessitates efficient ways to process and understand data, which visualizations can provide.
     - **Interactivity**: Modern data visualization tools offer interactive features that allow users to explore data dynamically, enhancing their analytical capabilities.
--
- .hlred[Enhanced analytics]
    - **Predictive analysis**: Visualizations can assist in predictive modeling and scenario analysis, helping policymakers anticipate future trends and prepare accordingly.
    - **Management "friendly"**: Visual tools enable rapid analysis and interpretation, which is crucial for timely decision-making in fast-paced policy environments.

# Lasswell model of communication **for DS**   

Laswell's framework of communication&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; dissects the task of communication along the following dimensions: (1) Who communicates (2) what (3) in what form (4) to whom (5) to what effect?

Let's apply this to us. Data scientists communicate...
&lt;/div&gt;

# Two ethical frameworks

.pull-left[
### Deontology

- [Follow ethical duties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology) that are derived from a set of rules independent of their consequences.
- Roots in the work of [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant). 
- The principle of *Respect for Persons* (autonomy) is deeply rooted in deontological thinking.
- Focused on **means**, not **ends**.

.pull-right[
### Consequentialism

- [Take actions that lead to better states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) in the world.
- Roots in [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) of [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham), [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill).
- The principle of *Beneficence* (risk/benefit analysis) is deeply rooted in consequentialist thinking.

# Ethical principles

.pull-left-wide[
- Ethical thinking is not an exercise of ticking boxes.
- A set of principles can guide researchers in reflecting about the ethical implications of their research.
- In different contexts these principles can come into conflict with each other.
- In fact, the most interesting cases are when the ethical implications of research involve trade-offs of principles.
- By making principles explicit, those trade-offs can be clarified and decisions better communicated.
- We will focus on the following four principles:

  1. Respect for persons
  2. Beneficence
  3. Justice
  4. Respect for law and public interest
