A type of systematic review that uses statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies.

    - Identifies patterns and overall trends
- **Limitations:**
    - Requires high-quality data (Garbage-in/garbage-out)
    - Heterogeneity among studies can complicate analysis

- **Comparison with Existing Literature**: How the findings align or contrast with previous research.

--
- **Implications for Research, Practice, and Policy**: Potential impact on practice, policy, or further research.

--
- **Synthesis of Findings**: Aggregated data from the studies, which may include quantitative data synthesis (meta-analysis) or qualitative synthesis.

# Meta-analyses

## <b>What</b> is a meta-analysis?
A particular flavor of systematic review, and statistical technique, conducted to combine the results of independent, but similar, studies to obtain an overall estimate of treatment effects.
]

--

<br>

## Important to consider

- **All meta-analyses** are based on a systematic review of the literature, but not all systematic reviews include a meta-analysis (i.e., the search strategy procedures align)

--
- During the process researchers need to consider the risk of missing unpublished studies, which might skew results (*File-drawer problem*)

--
- A big challenge for meta-analyses is the **standardization** of definitions of .i-pink[variables] and .i-pink[outcomes] across studies to ensure comparability
