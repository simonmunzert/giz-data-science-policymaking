## Challenge to knowledge cummulation
In all three cases, a .i-pink[macro-level question motivates the research, but the researcher has micro-level experimental evidence at hand]. The micro-level experiments seem to provide relevant evidence, but it is unclear what inferences to draw from this micro evidence for the macro questions.

- Suitable research designs
- Resource constraints
- Professional incentives (*one-time hitters problem*)
- ...

## Systematic reviews

Uses a structured and predefined methodology to gather and analyze all relevant studies on a specific research question.

- **Strengths:**
    - Comprehensive and transparent
    - Reproducible and less biased
- **Limitations:**
    - Resource-intensive
    - Subject to available materials (i.e., publication bias)

## Meta-analyses

A type of systematic review that uses statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies.

- **Purpose:** To increase statistical power and resolve uncertainties when individual studies disagree.
- **Strengths:**
    - Provides pooled estimates of effects
    - Identifies patterns and overall trends
- **Limitations:**
    - Requires high-quality data (Garbage-in/garbage-out)
    - Heterogeneity among studies can complicate analysis

&lt;br&gt;


## Expected output from the systematic review

- **Comparison with Existing Literature**: How the findings align or contrast with previous research.

--
- **Implications for Research, Practice, and Policy**: Potential impact on practice, policy, or further research.

--
- **Synthesis of Findings**: Aggregated data from the studies, which may include quantitative data synthesis (meta-analysis) or qualitative synthesis.

# Meta-analyses

.content-box-gray-wide[
## &lt;b&gt;What&lt;/b&gt; is a meta-analysis?
A particular flavor of systematic review, and statistical technique, conducted to combine the results of independent, but similar, studies to obtain an overall estimate of treatment effects.
]

--

&lt;br&gt;

## Important to consider

- **All meta-analyses** are based on a systematic review of the literature, but not all systematic reviews include a meta-analysis (i.e., the search strategy procedures align)

--
- During the process researchers need to consider the risk of missing unpublished studies, which might skew results (*File-drawer problem*)

--
- A big challenge for meta-analyses is the **standardization** of definitions of .i-pink[variables] and .i-pink[outcomes] across studies to ensure comparability
