# What constitutes scientific evidence? (cont.)


<br>
- Through this empirical method for knowledge acquisition, researchers strive to maintain objectivity and reduce partiality (<i style="color:#cc0065">It can be reproduced and tested</i>).

--

- The process allows researchers and research consumers to <i style="color:#cc0065">adjust</i> or <i style="color:#cc0065">discard</i> hypothesis based on results.

--

- Doing scientific research is a dynamic process, not a fixed sequence (<i style="color:#cc0065">Not all steps occur in every inquiry, nor in the same order</i>).

--

- Scientific research builds upon existing knowledge, contributing to the <i style="color:#cc0065">cumulative</i> advancement of understanding within a field through ongoing inquiry and discovery.

--

- Modern scientific practices increasingly emphasize <i style="color:#cc0065">openness</i> and <i style="color:#cc0065">transparency</i>, including data sharing, pre-registration of studies, and open access publication, promoting collaboration and accountability within the scientific community.

# Academic research articles

.pull-left-small[
## What are they?

An .hlblue[academic research article] is a **scholarly work**, mainly published in a peer-reviewed journal or proceedings. It presents original research findings, contributing to the knowledge and understanding of a specific field of study. 

They are **written by experts** and generally intended for other .i-pink[researchers], .i-pink[scholars], and .i-pink[professionals] within the same discipline.

# Statistical effects and effect sizes

.pull-left[
## What are statistical effects?
- Statistical effect quantify a difference or relationship between variables


## Example questions about effects
- What is the marginal effect of education on income?
- How much does the probability of voting increase with age?

## Statistical effect $\neq$ causal effect!
- Statistical effects are about statistical relationships between variables, not about causal relationships. 
- For instance, just because your model tells you that an additional 100$ per month income are associated with 1 additional year of education, you would not conclude that income causally increases education
]

--

.pull-right[
## Effect sizes
- Effect sizes are quantitative measures of the **strength of a relationship**.
- Effect sizes express the magnitude of a difference or relationship in a standardized way.

## Examples
- A (unstandardized or standardized) **group mean difference**
- The **correlation coefficient** is an effect size for the relationship between two continuous variables (see later!), e.g., $r = 0.1$ $\rightarrow$ weak, $r = 0.5$ $\rightarrow$ moderate, $r = 0.9$ $\rightarrow$ strong
- The **regression coefficient** expresses the predicted marginal change in an outcome relative to a unit change of the predictor (potentially conditionally on other covariates)

## A life and death example of statistical errors

You are a paramedic and you approach the scene of a car accident. One victim is laying motionless on the road and you must assess whether the victim is dead or alive, and the victim will be treated accordingly. Based on this information, **which error results in the most costly mistake?**

## Hypotheses

- **Null hypothesis**: The victim is alive.
- **Alternative hypothesis**: The victim is not alive.

# Assessing statistical significance

.pull-left[
## Statistical significance vs. practical significance
- They are not the same.
- Statistical significance is about the probability of observing the data given the null hypothesis. 
- Practical significance is about the real-world importance of the result.

## From hypothesis testing to statistical significance

**Three-step approach:**
1. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Calculate a test statistic. For instance, effect size in a regression divided by standard error.
3. Compare the test statistic to a critical value; calculate a p-value.
]

--

.pull-right[
## The p-value

- The p-value is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the observed result if the null hypothesis were true.
- The p-value is compared to a threshold (e.g., 0.05) to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
- .hlblue[Importantly, the p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false!]

<li>Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.</li>
<li>Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.</li>
<li>A p-value does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.</li>

# Predatory publishing

.pull-left[

## What is it?

> Predatory publishing, also write-only publishing or deceptive publishing, is an exploitative academic publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors while only superficially checking articles for quality and legitimacy, and without providing editorial and publishing services that legitimate academic journals provide, whether open access or not. The rejection rate of predatory journals is low, but seldom zero. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing)
