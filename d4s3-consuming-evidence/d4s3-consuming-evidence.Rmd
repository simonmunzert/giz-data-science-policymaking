# Why reviewing existing evidence matters

.pull-left[
<br>
## The Importance of Mapping the Literature

- **Comprehensive Understanding**: Mapping the literature provides a sharper picture of what research .i-pink[has already been done], helping to identify .i-pink[gaps] and .i-pink[avoid duplication].
- **Informed Decision-Making**: Access to a wide range of studies allows for more informed and evidence-based policy decisions.
- **Contextual Insights**: Understanding the .i-pink[historical and current trends] in the field can contextualize new findings within the broader landscape of knowledge.

# Why reviewing existing evidence matters (cont.)
.pull-left[

## Knowledge Accumulation

- **Building on Previous Work**: Reviewing existing evidence helps in building upon prior research, .i-pink[ensuring continuity and progress] in the field.
- **Innovative Solutions**: By understanding what has worked (and what hasn’t) in the past, researchers and policymakers can .i-pink[develop more innovative and effective solutions].
- **Credibility, Certainty, and Rigor**: A thorough literature review can enhance your .i-pink[certainty about potential actions], as well as the credibility of your work, demonstrating a rigorous and methodical approach to research.

# Research databases

.pull-left[
<br>
## What is a Research Database?

A research database is an organized .i-pink[collection of sources, data, and references] to academic articles, books, reports, and other scholarly materials, typically accessible online.

- Purpose: Designed to help researchers (*and users in general*) locate and retrieve relevant information quickly and efficiently.

- Features: Often includes search functionalities, filters, and tools to refine and manage results.

# Scholarly publishing

.pull-left[
<div align="center">
<img src="../pics/d4-s3-lock-traditional.png" height=200>
</div>

## Traditional

- **Access**: 
    - Restricted to subscribers or institutional members.
- **Cost**: 
    - Often high subscription fees for institutions; individual articles can be expensive.
- **Reach**: 
    - Limited to those who can afford access or have institutional subscriptions.
- **Copyright**: 
    - Typically held by the publisher, with limited rights for authors to share their work.

.pull-right[
<div align="center">
<img src="../pics/d4-s3-open-access-icon.png" height=200>

## Open access

- **Access**: 
    - Free and unrestricted access to everyone.
- **Cost**: 
    - Often funded by author fees (Article Processing Charges, APCs) or institutional support.
- **Reach**: 
    - Wider audience including researchers, practitioners, and the general public.
- **Copyright**: 
    - Authors often retain copyright, with more freedom to share and distribute their work.

# Preprints and self-archiving

.pull-left[

## Preprints

Early versions of research papers .hlred[shared publicly before formal peer review].

- **Purpose**: Facilitate early dissemination of findings and foster feedback from the research community.
- **Platforms**: Common platforms include arXiv, OSF, Zenodo, and SSRN.
- **Benefits**:
    - Rapid Sharing: Accelerates the dissemination of research findings.
    - Community Feedback: Receives early input and suggestions from peers.
    - Visibility: Increases visibility and citation potential prior to formal publication.
- **Considerations**:
    - Quality Control: Lacks formal peer review initially.
    - Acceptance: Some journals may have policies regarding preprint submissions.

# Use with care

## Limitations of AI tools

- **Quality of Data Input:** AI tools heavily rely on the quality and relevance of the data inputted. If the initial data used to train the AI model is biased or incomplete, it can affect the accuracy of the results generated by the tool. (**Garbage in/garbage out**)

--
- **Limited Contextual Understanding:** AI tools may lack the ability to understand the broader context of a research topic or the specific needs of a policymaker. This can lead to oversights or inaccuracies in the synthesis of evidence.

--
- **Inability to Handle Ambiguity:** AI tools may struggle with ambiguity or uncertainty present in research literature. They may not effectively handle conflicting findings or nuanced interpretations, which are common in complex policy areas.

--
- **Risk of Overlooking Unconventional Sources:** AI tools often prioritize well-established sources and may overlook valuable insights from non-traditional or emerging sources of evidence, such as preprints, grey literature, or community reports.

--
- **Difficulty in Adapting to Rapidly Evolving Fields:** In fast-paced fields where new research emerges frequently, AI tools may struggle to keep pace with the latest developments and may not provide up-to-date synthesis of evidence.

---

# Use with care (cont.)

## Limitations of AI tools

- **Lack of Transparency:** Some AI algorithms operate as black boxes, meaning they lack transparency in how they arrive at their conclusions. This can make it challenging for users to understand and interpret the rationale behind the recommendations or results provided by the tool.

--
- **Dependency on Technical Skills:** Using AI tools often requires a certain level of technical proficiency, including understanding how to interpret and adjust algorithm parameters. This can create barriers for users who lack the necessary skills or training.

--
- **Cost and Accessibility:** Some AI-powered tools may come with significant costs or subscription fees, making them inaccessible to users with limited budgets or resources, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

--
- **Ethical Considerations:** AI tools may inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the data or algorithm design, leading to unintended consequences such as reinforcing existing disparities or overlooking marginalized voices.

--
- **Human Oversight and Validation Required:** Despite the automation provided by AI tools, human oversight and validation are still essential to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and ethical integrity of the synthesized evidence.
